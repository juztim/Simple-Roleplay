# Simple Roleplay

Simple Roleplay is a rather complete roleplay gamemode for [alt:V](https://altv.mp/). The server was fully coded in C#.
The [client](https://github.com/juztim/simple-roleplay-client) source is also available. It contains the frontend and the client code in general.

### ⚙ Installation / Support
